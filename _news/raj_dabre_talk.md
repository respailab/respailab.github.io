# Talk with Professor and Senior Scientist Raj Dabre

**Discussion on Advancements in Multilingual Machine Translation and LLMs for Indian Languages**

Professor and Senior Scientist Raj Dabre recently delivered a comprehensive talk covering significant progress in the fields of multilingual machine translation and large language models (LLMs). A key focus of his discussion was the application and development of these technologies specifically for Indian languages, highlighting their growing importance and the unique challenges they present.

The talk delved into several key initiatives aimed at bridging the technological gap for Indian languages, including:

* **IndicNLPLama:** A multilingual language model designed to support various Indian languages.
* **IndicTrans2:** A large-scale project providing a parallel corpus and a machine translation model for 22 Indian languages.
* **IndicLLM Suite:** An effort focused on building extensive monolingual datasets for Indian languages through various data generation techniques.
* **RomanSetu:** An approach exploring the use of romanization to enhance the performance of LLMs on Indian languages.

Professor Dabre also addressed critical aspects such as the scarcity of data for Indian languages and the importance of robust evaluation metrics like IndicCOMET, a neural metric fine-tuned for Indian languages. The discussion further touched upon leveraging prompting and retrieval methods to improve LLM capabilities in machine translation and the broader challenges and opportunities in training culturally relevant LLMs.

The full talk is available on YouTube for those interested in a deeper dive into these topics.
