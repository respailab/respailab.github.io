Welcome to our research lab, led by [Dr. Murari Mandal](https://murarimandal.github.io/). At RespAI Lab, we focus on advancing large language models (LLMs) by addressing challenges related to long-content processing, inference efficiency, interpretability, and alignment. Our research also explores synthetic persona creation, regulatory issues, and innovative methods for model merging, knowledge verification, and unlearning.

<b>Motto of RespAI Lab</b>: Driving technical breakthroughs in AI through cutting-edge research and innovation, with a focus on solving complex challenges in LLMs and other generative models and contribute to top-tier conferences (ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, AAAI, KDD, CVPR, ICCV, etc.) in the pursuit of cutting-edge advancements.
