Welcome to our research lab, led by [Dr. Murari Mandal](https://murarimandal.github.io/), we are dedicated to advancing the field of responsible AI. Our team explores crucial aspects of AI such as privacy, machine unlearning, data valuation, synthetic data, and generative AI. Through innovative research and collaboration, we aim to develop ethical, regulatable AI technologies that prioritize user privacy and data integrity, ensuring a fair and transparent digital future.

## <b>Current Research</b>
- Addressing Challenges in Long-Content Processing for LLMs: Investigating solutions to performance bottlenecks, memory limitations, latency issues, and information loss when dealing with extended content lengths in large language models (LLMs).
  
- Optimizing LLM Inference Efficiency: Developing strategies to reduce the computational cost of LLM inference, focusing on improving speed, memory usage, and leveraging smaller models for complex tasks.

- Interpretability and Alignment of Generative AI Models: Exploring the interpretability of generative AI models, aligning their outputs with human values, and addressing the issue of hallucinations in model responses.

- Synthetic Persona and Society Creation: Creating and studying synthetic personalities, communities, and societies within LLMs, and analyzing the behaviors and dynamics of these synthetic constructs.

- Regulatory Challenges in LLMs: Investigating regulatory concerns surrounding LLMs, including the implementation of unlearning techniques to comply with data privacy regulations and enhance model fairness.

- Model Merging and Knowledge Verification: Developing methods for merging multiple models, editing model behavior, and verifying the accuracy and consistency of the knowledge they generate.
