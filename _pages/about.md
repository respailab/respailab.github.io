Welcome to our research lab, led by [Dr. Murari Mandal](https://murarimandal.github.io/). At RespAI Lab, we focus on advancing large language models (LLMs) by addressing challenges related to long-content processing, inference efficiency, interpretability, and alignment. Our research also explores synthetic persona creation, regulatory issues, and innovative methods for model merging, knowledge verification, and unlearning.

## <b>Ongoing Research at RespAI Lab</b>
- Addressing Challenges in Long-Content Processing for LLMs: Investigating solutions to performance bottlenecks, memory limitations, latency issues, and information loss when dealing with extended content lengths in large language models (LLMs).
  
- Optimizing LLM Inference Efficiency: Developing strategies to reduce the computational cost of LLM inference, focusing on improving speed, memory usage, and leveraging smaller models for complex tasks.

- Interpretability and Alignment of Generative AI Models: Exploring the interpretability of generative AI models, aligning their outputs with human values, and addressing the issue of hallucinations in model responses.

- Synthetic Persona and Society Creation: Creating and studying synthetic personalities, communities, and societies within LLMs, and analyzing the behaviors and dynamics of these synthetic constructs.

- Regulatory Challenges in LLMs: Investigating regulatory concerns surrounding LLMs, including the implementation of unlearning techniques to comply with data privacy regulations and enhance model fairness.

- Model Merging and Knowledge Verification: Developing methods for merging multiple models, editing model behavior, and verifying the accuracy and consistency of the knowledge they generate.
