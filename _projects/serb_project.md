## Introduction

Welcome to our exploration of cutting-edge research in machine unlearning! Our project, supported by the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), aims to address one of the most pressing concerns in today's digital age: the selective removal of digital data footprints from deep learning models.

## Project Overview

In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, the ability to unlearn specific data points from a trained model is crucial. This capability is essential for complying with privacy regulations, such as the GDPR, and for ensuring that models do not perpetuate biases or inaccuracies associated with certain data.

## Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to develop methodologies for effectively and efficiently removing specific data from deep learning models without compromising their overall performance. This involves:

- Designing algorithms for selective data removal.
- Ensuring the model's robustness and accuracy post-unlearning.
- Addressing the challenges of data integrity and consistency.

## Current Progress

Since the project's inception in January 2024, significant strides have been made:

- **Algorithm Development:** Initial prototypes of unlearning algorithms have been tested with promising results.
- **Model Training:** Deep learning models have been trained with diverse datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the unlearning process.
- **Budget Utilization:** Out of the total budget of 30,50,300 INR, 23,30,000 INR has been released and utilized effectively to support research activities.

## Future Directions

As we move forward, our focus will be on refining these algorithms, conducting extensive testing, and ensuring their scalability and applicability in real-world scenarios. Collaboration with industry partners and continued support from SERB will be instrumental in achieving our objectives.
